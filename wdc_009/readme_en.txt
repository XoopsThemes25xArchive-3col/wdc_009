This is the readme to our WDC_009 Theme.

Thanks that you chosen our WDC_009 theme.

This readme will help you to configure the menu and the reflection of images if you want.

You will find the html file witch is controlling the dock menu in the folder menu. The name is menu.html.

Each link is in this form:

<a class="dock-item" href="index.php"><img src="<{xoImgUrl menu/images/025.png}>" alt="Home" /><span>Home</span></a>

You can change the following options:

1. href="" this is the link to the module you want to link
2. the image tag: change just the number of the img you want to show for the link, in this pack there are 131 different images ready for the menu.
3. alt="" this will show the name of the link if the picture is not able to display
4. The name of the menu is between the <span></span> tag. This will show the name of the menu under the image

If you want to show a reflection under your images like the leafs beside the blocktitles, you only have to give the pictures the following class: class="reflect" in the Templates. You have to put the class in the img tag like this <img src="" class="reflect" />

Enjoy the theme
Your WDC Team
